        <h1>Varian Wrynn</h1>
        <p>"I am the King of Stormwind and no one, not the naga, nor the Scourge, nor the fiery lords of the Burning Legion
            will keep me from my people!"</p>
        <p>Varian Wrynn, also called Lo'Gosh the "Ghost Wolf", the son of the late King Llane Wrynn, was the acting leader of
            the Alliance, and the former King of Stormwind. Under his leadership, the humans of Stormwind led the Alliance
            to victory against the Lich King in Northrend, and now seek to bolster their strategic holdings against their
            perennial enemy, "the Horde". With the world plunged into chaos by the great Cataclysm, he took up military leadership
            of the Alliance, and vowed to forge a new destiny for Azeroth.</p>
